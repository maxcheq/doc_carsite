My website about the car will be about a specific car, the Audi 80, for now, it will show technical specifications, photos of the car and its types of equipment. The site is needed so that users can learn about the problem areas of the car and be able to solve them in time. It is also possible that a forum will be added to discuss any technical problems of the car.

The site will be intended for everyone, including both ordinary people and car enthusiasts. That is, to make the most convenient, understandable and informative structure and navigation.

The site will have the ability to view the history of the car, types of equipment and a list of all possible versions. I would like the photo of the car to take up more space on the site than usual, so that users could examine the car in detail. There will also be a list of problems and their solutions. I would also like to add the ability to compare the benefits of a car by price, for example, a quattro car with minor problems for 2000 euros will be better than a regular Audi 80 but in good condition for the same money. I would like to make cards with spare parts so that you can easily divide the problems into groups. For example, interior, engine, chassis, controls, electronics.

And news and articles about the car can also be added, and anyone can do it.

Of course, you can choose a car by specific criteria, such as year, engine, drive, edition, market, etc.

There will be 5 main tabs on the site, which ones are hard to say now, but it could be articles, repair, gallery, forum, and something else.

The site will have many filter options and criteria for choosing a car model.

The site will be written frontend in html, css, heat script, so far so good. Backend possibly php or go)

The main point of the site is to provide the opportunity for good design and information for car users, whether for dummies or for experts. Style, convenience, practicality and information is what describes the site and will distinguish it from others.
